# üí¨ FAQ

- **What is the motivation for this?** Most of the Party Ability Bar (PAB) addons for 3.3.5a were pretty basic. I wanted something a little more advanced.

- **X and Y doesn't work!** There have been numerous structural changes to the addon to optimize it from the original source, both for resources and readability. The posibility for something to slip through testing is high.

- **I found a bug!** Please üìã [report the issue](https://gitlab.com/Tsoukie/tsoukiepartytracker/-/issues) with as much detail as possible.
